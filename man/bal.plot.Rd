\title{
Generate Univariate Balance Plots
}
\description{
Generates density plots, bar graphs, or scatterplots displaying distributional balance between treatment and covariates using \pkg{ggplot2}.
}
\usage{
bal.plot(obj, 
    var.name, 
    ..., 
    which, 
    which.sub = NULL, 
    cluster = NULL, 
    which.cluster = NULL, 
    imp = NULL, 
    which.imp = NULL, 
    which.treat = NULL,
    which.time = NULL,
    size.weight = FALSE,
    mirror = FALSE, 
    type = c("density", "histogram"), 
    colors = NULL,
    sample.names)
}
\arguments{
  \item{obj}{
the object for which balance is to be assessed; can be any object for which there is support in \code{bal.tab}.
}
  \item{var.name}{
\code{character}; the name of the variable whose values are to be plotted. To view distributions of the distance measure (e.g., propensity score), if any, use \code{"distance"} as the argument unless the distance variable has been named. If there are duplicate variable names across inputs, \code{bal.plot()} will first look in the covariate \code{data.frame} from \code{obj}, followed by \code{addl}, and then \code{distance}, if any. If not specified, will use the first covariate available with a warning.
}
  \item{\dots}{
other arguments to define the variable, treatment, and weights. Some inputs are required depending on the method. See Additional Arguments. Can also be used to supply the \code{bw}, \code{adjust}, \code{kernel}, and \code{n} arguments for \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_density}} and the \code{bins} argument for \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_histogram}}.
}
  \item{which}{
whether to display distributional balance for the adjusted (\code{"adjusted"}) or unadjusted sample (\code{"unadjusted"}) or both at the same time (\code{"both"}). When multiple weights are present, the names of the weights can be supplied, too. The default is to display balance for the adjusted sample only unless no weights, subclasses, or matching strata are specified. Multiple values and abbreviations allowed.
 }
  \item{which.sub}{
\code{numeric}; if subclassification is used, a vector corresponding to the subclass(es) for which the distributions are to be displayed. If \code{NULL} (the default), distributions from all subclasses are displayed in a grid.
}
  \item{cluster}{
optional; a vector of cluster membership, or the name of a variable in an available data set passed to \code{bal.plot()} that contains cluster membership.
}
  \item{which.cluster}{
if clusters are used, which cluster(s) to display. Can be cluster names or numerical indices for which to display balance. Indices correspond to the alphabetical order of cluster names. If \code{NULL} (the default) or \code{NA}, all clusters are displayed.
}
  \item{imp}{
optional; a vector of imputation indices, or the name of a variable in an available data set passed to \code{bal.plot()} that contains imputation indices.
}
  \item{which.imp}{
if imputations are used, which imputations(s) to display. Must be numerical indices for which to display balance. If \code{NULL} (the default) or \code{NA}, all imputations are displayed.
}
  \item{which.treat}{
which treatment groups to display. If \code{NULL} (the default) or \code{NA}, all treatment groups are displayed.
}
  \item{which.time}{
for longitudinal treatments, which time points to display. Can be treatment names or time period indices. If \code{NULL} (the default) or \code{NA}, all time points are displayed.
}
  \item{size.weight}{
\code{logical}; if both the treatment and the covariate are continuous, whether points should be sized according to their weight. 
}
  \item{mirror}{
\code{logical}; if the treatment is binary, whether to display mirrored densities/histograms or overlapping densities/histograms. Ignored otherwise. 
}
  \item{type}{
for binary and multinomial treatments, whether to display histograms or densities. The default is to display densities. Abbreviations are allowed.
}
  \item{colors}{
a vector of colors for the plotted densities/histograms. See 'Color Specification' at \code{\link[graphics]{par}}. Defaults to the default \pkg{ggplot2} colors.
}
  \item{sample.names}{
\code{character}; new names to be given to the samples (i.e., in place of "Unadjusted Sample" and "Adjusted Sample"). For example, when matching it used, it may be useful to enter \code{c("Unmatched", "Matched")}.
}
}
\section{Additional Arguments}{
\code{bal.plot()} works like \code{bal.tab()} in that it can take a variety of types of inputs and yield the same output for each. Depending on what kind of input is given, different additional parameters are required in \code{\dots}. For details on what is required and allowed for each additional input and their defaults, see the help file for the \code{\link{bal.tab}} method associated with the input. The following are the required additional arguments based on each input type (optional arguments in parentheses):

For \code{matchit} objects: None

For \code{weightit} objects: None

For \code{ps}, \code{ps.cont}, \code{mnps}, and \code{iptw} objects: (\code{stop.method}; see \link[=bal.tab.ps]{defaults}).

For \code{Match} objects: \code{formula} and \code{data} or \code{covs} and \code{treat}.

For \code{optmatch} objects: \code{formula} and \code{data} or \code{covs} and \code{treat}.

For \code{CBPS} objects: None

For \code{ebalance} objects: \code{formula} and \code{data} or \code{covs} and \code{treat}.

For \code{formula}s: \code{data}, \code{weights}, (\code{distance}), (\code{method}; see \link[=bal.tab.formula]{defaults})

For \code{data.frame}s: \code{treat}, (\code{data}), \code{weights}, (\code{distance}), (\code{method}; see \link[=bal.tab.data.frame]{defaults})

For \code{designmatch} objects: \code{formula} and \code{data} or \code{covs} and \code{treat}.

For other objects processed through \code{bal.tab}'s default method, whichever arguments are required to identify treatment, variables, and a conditioning method (if any).

}
\details{
\code{bal.plot()} uses \code{ggplot()} from the \pkg{ggplot2} package, and (invisibly) returns a \code{"ggplot"} object. For categorical treatments with continuous covariates or continuous treatments with categorical covariates, density plots are created using \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_density}}, and histograms are created using \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_histogram}}; for categorical treatments with categorical covariates, bar graphs are created using \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_bar}}; for continuous treatments with continuous covariates, scatterplots are created using \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_point}}.

For continuous treatments with continuous covariates, three additional lines are presented for aid in balance assessment. The dashed blue line is the linear fit line. The solid blue line is a Loess fit curve generated with \pkg{ggplot2}'s \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_smooth}} with \code{method = "loess"}. The solid black line is a horizontal reference line intercepting the (weighted) treatment mean. Proximity of the fit lines to the reference line is indicative of independence between the covariate and treatment variable.

When multiple plots are to be displayed (i.e., when requesting subclass balance, cluster balance, or imputation balance, or when multiple sets of weights are provided or \code{which = "both"}, or when treatment is longitudinal), the plots will be displayed in a grid using \pkg{ggplot2}'s \code{\link[ggplot2]{facet_grid}}. Subclassification cannot be used with clusters or multiply imputed data.

\value{
A \code{"ggplot"} object, returned invisibly.
